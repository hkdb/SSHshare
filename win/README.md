   ```
   PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy"

- [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)
    - wget
    - gcc (Development Only)
    - Go (Development Only)

### Delta:

- ssh-vault will be included in the release zip

- ssh-vault will be installed at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps

- The two DLL files must be in the same directory as the compiled exe for it to run properly.

- SSHshare will be installed in C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\SSHshare\

- A desktop shortcut will be automatically made.

### Compiling:

Execute the following if you are compiling for the first time:

Open Powershell as Administrator:
```
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy"
```
Note: This is to allow hosting a webserver on localhost which is the backend of the application

From the cloned repo:

```
go get
go get github.com/akavel/rsrc
go get github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo
```

If it doesn't work, you may need to do the following:
```
go get -u github.com/zserge/webview
```
Execute the following scripts starting at the top level of the repo:

```
.\build.bat
```

### Distribution:

Package zip for release starting from top level of repo:

```
# Change version number in version.info first
.\build.bat
cd win
.\dist.bat -v <version>
```
Now you should have win/SSHshare-`<version>`-x64-win10.zip ready for distribution
